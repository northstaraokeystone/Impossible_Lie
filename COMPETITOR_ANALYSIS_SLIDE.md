# THE TRUST GAP: Why "Detection" Isn't Enough

## The Comparison

| Capability | The Incumbents (Spin.AI, Obsidian) | SaaSGuard (Unbreakable Chain) |
|------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Data Source** | Text Logs (Mutable, Deletable) | Cryptographic Ledger (Immutable) |
| **Backup Strategy** | "Restore Fast" (Hope it's clean) | "Verify First" (Prove it's clean) |
| **Insider Threat** | Blind to Root Access / DB Admin | Captures Root Access (Sidecar Audit) |
| **End Product** | A Dashboard Screenshot | A Court-Admissible Affidavit |

## The Bottom Line

> "Logs are opinions. Hashes are facts. Don't just recover—prove it."

## The Landmine Question

Ask any incumbent vendor:

*"Is your log mutable? Can a root admin delete it?"*

The answer is yes. That's the gap we fill.

## Market Position

- **Spin.AI** sells Recovery → We sell **Admissibility**
- **Obsidian** sells Detection → We sell **Proof**
- **Splunk** sells Monitoring → We sell **Evidence**

"Recovery without Proof is just restoring the crime scene."

## The Strategic Insight

**The Attack Vector:** They sell "Recovery." We sell "Admissibility."

**The Kill Shot:** "Recovery without Proof is just restoring the crime scene."

**The Landmine:** Force every buyer to ask Spin.AI: "Is your log mutable? Can a root admin delete it?" The answer is yes. We just killed their sales cycle.

## Sales Cycle Impact

**Before:** Buyer evaluates SaaSGuard vs. Spin.AI on features

**After:** Buyer asks Spin.AI "Can a root admin delete your logs?" → Spin.AI says yes → Buyer eliminates Spin.AI → SaaSGuard wins by default

**We didn't beat them. We disqualified them.**
